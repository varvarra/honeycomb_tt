# Honeycomb Engineering Test - Makers Edition

## The challenge

We have a system that delivers advertising materials to broadcasters.

Advertising Material is uniquely identified by a 'Clock' number e.g.

* `WNP/SWCL001/010`
* `ZDW/EOWW005/010`

Our sales team have some new promotions they want to offer so
we need to introduce a mechanism for applying Discounts to orders.

Promotions like this can and will change over time so we need the solution to be flexible.

## Specifications


### User Stories

```
As an advertising agency,
So that I can receive a discount of 10% for sending  advertising materials to broadcasters,
I should spend over 30$ on my order

```

```
As an advertising agency,
So that the price of the express delivery goes down to 15$ for my order,
I should send 2 or more materials in that order via express delivery

```


### Broadcasters

These are the Broadcasters we deliver to

* Viacom

### Discounts

### What we want from you

Provide a means of defining and applying various discounts to the cost of delivering material to broadcasters.

We don't need any UI for this, we just need you to show us how it would work through its API.

## Examples

Based on the both Discounts applied, the following examples should be valid:

* send `WNP/SWCL001/010` to Disney, Discovery, Viacom via Standard Delivery and Horse and Country via Express Delivery
    based on the defined Discounts the total should be $45.00

* send `ZDW/EOWW005/010` to Disney, Discovery, Viacom via Express Delivery
     based on the defined Discounts the total should be $40.50

     def no_discount_total(items)
       @total = items.inject(0) { |memo, (_, delivery)| memo += delivery.price }
     end
